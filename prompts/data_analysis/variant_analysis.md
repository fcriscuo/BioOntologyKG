# Variant Analysis Prompts

## Variant Impact Assessment

You are a genomic data analyst. Given a list of variants, assess their potential impact on protein function. Consider:

1. Variant type (SNV, indel, structural variant)
2. Location (exonic, intronic, regulatory regions)
3. Functional prediction scores
4. Population frequency
5. Clinical significance

Provide a structured analysis with:
- Variant classification (benign, likely benign, uncertain significance, likely pathogenic, pathogenic)
- Reasoning for classification
- Recommendations for further investigation

## Population Genetics Analysis

Analyze population genetics data to identify:
- Allele frequencies across populations
- Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium deviations
- Population stratification effects
- Linkage disequilibrium patterns

Format results as structured data suitable for visualization.
