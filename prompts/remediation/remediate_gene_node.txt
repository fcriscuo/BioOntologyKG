Good Afternoon. I have reviewed the schema of my genomic Neo4j knowledge graph and have decided to implement
some design changes to consolidate nodes with overlapping properties (e.g. biolink:Gene and Gene).
Two (2) database operations need to be completed for each pair of overlapping nodes:
(1) copy a subset of node properties from the redundant node to the retained node
(2) move relationships from the redundant node to the retained node.
For example to eliminate the need for redundant Gene nodes:
1. Process every Gene node
2. Match a Gene (g) node to an equivalent biolink:Gene (bg) node based on g.GENE_SYMBOL = bg.symbol
3. If there is a match, copy the following properties from the Gene node to the biolink:Gene node, if not null:
    ENTREZ_GENE_SUMMARY
    gene_summary_embedding
    CYTOGENIC_LOCATION
4. Move the following relationships form the Gene (g) node to the matching biolink:Gene (bg) node:
    COSMIC_GENE (cg) -[:HAS_GENE] ->Gene (g) moved to COSMIC_GENE (cg) -[:HAS_GENE] ->biolink:Gene (bg)
    Gene (g) -[:HAS_PUBLICATION]-> PubMedArticle (p)   moved to biolink:Gene (bg) -[:HAS_PUBLICATION]-> PubMedArticle(p)
    The HAS_PUBLICATION relationship should only be moved if the equivalent biolink:Gene node does not already have the
    same HAS_PUBLICATION relationship
5. DETACH AND DELETE the Gene node

Please generate a Cyoher QueryLanguage (CQL) to perform this node remediation
