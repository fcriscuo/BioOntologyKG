As a Neo4j v5 expert, please generate a Neo4j v5 Cypher Query Language (CQL) script that 
establishes a Neo4j relationship between an existing UniProt node and one or more existing GoTerm nodes.
The script must adheres to the following specidications
1. The CQL must conform to Neo4j v5 syntax
2. Every UniProt node in the database must be processed
3. Each UniProt node has a 'Gene Ontology IDs' property which represents a list of related GoTerms
4. Each value from a UniProt node's 'Gene Ontology IDs' propert maps to a GoTerm nodes id property.
5. The script should create a Neo4j relattionship between the current UniProt node and the identified GoTerm node.
6. The name of the  relationship is determined by the value of the GoTerm node's namespace value, converted to upper case, prefixed by 'HAS_'
7 Example:
    a. UniProt Entrty=A0A1B0GTW7  GO_ONTOLOGY_ID:GO:0004222    GoTerm id:GO:0004222  namespace: molecular_function
       Cypher: MATCH(u:UniProt) WHERE u.Entry='A0A1B0GTW7'
              // process each item in th list of 'GENE_ONTOLOGY_IDs'
               MATCH(g:GoTERM) WHERE g.id='GO:0004222'
               MERGE (g)-[r:HAS_MOLECULAR_FUNCTION]->(g)
8. Use Neo4j v5 batch processing
9. Do not attempt to execute the CQL script
10. Output the script to cql/import/uniprot_go_relationship.cql
