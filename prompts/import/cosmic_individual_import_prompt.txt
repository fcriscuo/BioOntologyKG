As a Neo4j v5 expert, please generate a Cypher Query Language (CQL) script that 
will import COSMIC_CancerGeneCensus data from a tsv-formatted file. Please adhere to 
the following specifications:
- The tsv input file is file:///Volumes/SSD870/COSMIC_rel102/Import/Cosmic_Sample_v102_GRCh38.tsv
- The first line in this file consist of column headings.
- Each subsequent row in the file should be used to create a new COSMIC_Individual node.
- A file row should not be processed if a COSMIC_Individual node with the same INDIVIDUAL_ID already exists in the database
- Only import the following columns: INDIVIDUAL_ID, GENDER, AGE, AGE_AT_TUMOUR_RECURRENCE, ETHNICITY, ENVIRONMENTAL_VARIABLES,
  THERAPY,FAMILY, and INDIVIDUAL_REMARK
- The properties AGE and AGE_AT_TUMOUR_RECURRENCE should be imported as integers
- The CQL script should include a transaction to DETACH and DELETE all COSMIC_Individual nodes to facilitate 
  rerunning the script.
- The generated script should be written out to cql/import/import_cosmic_individual.cql
- Do not attempt to execute the CQL script
