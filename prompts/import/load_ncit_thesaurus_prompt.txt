Please generate a Cypher Query Language (CQL) script that will import data from a specified CSV into a local Neo4j 5.2025 database.
The first line of the CSV file contains column headers. Each subsequent line should generate a node in
the Neo4j database. The new node should be labeled NCIT_Term.Each column in a line represents a
property for the new NCIT_Term node. With the exception, of the "Class ID" column, the property name is the same as the
column name (e.g. Synonyms, Semantic Types, etc.). Property names derived from column names that are
composed of multiple words, should have their spaces converted to underscores (e.g. "Semantic Types" should map
to a Semantic_Type property name). The "CLASS ID" column should be ignored.
The "code" column should map to a property named NCIT_ID.
The script should contain Cypher commands to ensure that the NCIT_ID value is
unique.  The following environment variables: NEO4J_URI, NEO4J_USERNAME, NEO4J_PASSWORD, and NEO4J_DATABASE should be to
establish a connection to the local Neo4j database. The generated CQL script should be entitled "load_ncit_thesaurus.cql".
The generated CQL must comform to Neo4j v5 syntax.
Please use the substring '//' instead of '--' to designate a comment (e.g. // This is a comment).  Please place the row
processing logic within a Cypher "CALL { ....} IN TRANSACTIONS OF 1000 Rows" framework.
Column values that contain the pipe character (i.e. |) (e.g. Synonyms), should be split using | as a delimiter and the
resulting values persisted as a List of strings in the Neo4j database (e.g. A|B|C maps to [A,B,C].
