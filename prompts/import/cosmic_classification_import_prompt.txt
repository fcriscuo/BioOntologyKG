As a Neo4j v5 expert, please generate a Cypher Query Language (CQL) script that 
will import COSMIC_Classification data from a tsv-formatted file. Please adhere to 
the following specifications:
1. The input tsv file is /Volumes/SSD870/COSMIC_rel102/Cosmic_Classification_Tsv_v102_GRCh38/Cosmic_Classification_Tsv_v102_GRCh38.tsv
2. The first line of the tsv file consist of column headings
3. After the header line, each subsequent line should be used to create a new COSMIC_Classification node.
4. Each column in a tsv row should be used to create a property in the COSMIC_Classification node. The property name should be
   the same as the column name,
5. The CQL script ahould create a UNIQUE constraint on the COSMIC_PHENOTYPE_ID property in the COSMIC_Classification node
6. The CQL script shouls contain a Cypher command to DETACH and DELETE all COSMIC_Classification nodes to faciliate
   rerunning the script as needed
7. The CQL script shoulsd create a "HAS_NCIT" relationship from the NCI_CODE value in the COSMIC_Classification and the 
   NCI_CODE value in the NCIT_Term
8. The CQL script should be outputted as cql/import/import_cosmic_classification.cql
9. Do not attempt to execute the CQL script.
