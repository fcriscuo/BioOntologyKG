As an expert Neo4j v5 developer, please create a Cypher Query Language (CQL) script that will import
HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) data from a specified tsv file into a local Neo4j v5 database.
Please carefully follow the following specifications:
1. Create a Neo4j v5 constraint that ensures that the hgnc_id value is unique.
2. The tsv formatted input file is locates at /Volumes/SSD870/data/HGNC/hgnc_complete_set.tsv
3. The first row in the tsv file is a header and each column name should be mapped to a Neo4j node property with the
    same name
4. Each subsequent row, after the header, in the tsv file should create a new node labeled HGNC.
5 Every entry (i.e. column) should be imported into the new node as string properties, and the property
   name should be the same as the column name.
6. The imports should be processed in batches of 1000 rows.
7. Column values that contain the pipe character (i.e. |) (e.g. pubmed_id), should be split using | as a delimiter and the
   resulting values persisted as a List of strings in the Neo4j database (e.g. A|B|C maps to [A,B,C].
8. Column names starting with "date" (e.g. date_name_changed) should be ignored
9. Before importing data from the tsv file,the CQL script should DETACH snd DELETE any existing HGNC nodes in the
   database. This will facilitate re-running the script after modifications. To avoid memory issues, this operation
   should be performed in batches of 1000
10. The following environment variables: NEO4J_URI, NEO4J_USERNAME, NEO4J_PASSWORD, and NEO4J_DATABASE should be to
    establish a connection to the local Neo4j database.Please p
11  Pay particular attention to Neo4j v5 revised syntax for batch transactions
12. Please note that the Cypher "CALL {} IN TRANSACTIONS OF 1000 ROWS" has been deprecated and replaced with "CALL () {}"
12. Write out the generated Cypher code to ./cql/import directory
13. Do not attempt to execute the generated CQL script
