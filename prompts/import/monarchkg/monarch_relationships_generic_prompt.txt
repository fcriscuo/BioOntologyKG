As a Neo4j v2025 and Python 3 expert, please create a Python 3 script that will generate and execute
a Cypher Query Language (CQL) that will import MonarchKG relationship data from a tsv-formatted file.
Each MonarchKG relationship file represents data for a specific relationship
(e.g (Biolink:Gene -[:biolink:causes] -> (biolink:Disease).
All the relationship files have the same columns to represent a relationship (e.g. subject -predicate ->object).
Therefor it's possible to generate a CQL to import relationship data from any of the MonarchKG
relationship file.

1. The Python script should prompt the user to enter the full path name for the relationship file.
2. In processing the Specified file, only rows where the "subject_taxon" column has a value
   of "NCBITaxon:9606" should be imported. Rows with a different value for "subject_taxon" should be ignored.
3. For each row that passes the subject taxon filter, the Python script should generate CQL to create a
   Neo4j relationship in a local Neo4j v2025 database. The parameters need to establish a Neo4j connection
   (i.e. user, database, uri, and password) should be obtained via OS environment settings.
4.The value of the "subject_category" column represents the node label for the source node
  in the Neo4j relationship
5 The value of the "subject" column represents the "id" property of the source node
6. The value of the "predicate" column represents the label for the Neo4j relationship.
7. The value of the "primary_knowledge_source" column represents a "primary_knowledge_source"
   property for the Neo4j relationship.
8. If the "publications" column contains one or more values, they should be imported as a List as
   a "publications" property for the Neo4j relationship
9. The value of the "object_category" column represents the Neo4j node label for the target of the
   Neo4j relationship
10. The value of the "object" column represents the "id" property of the target node
11. Some of the TSV files are very large so the rows should be processed in transactions of 1000 rows.
12. The python script should report the number of relationships created

Example:
Input row from TSV file
subject="HGNC:11802"
subject_category="biolink:Gene"
subject_taxon="NCBITaxon:9606"
predicate="biolink:causes"
object_category="biolink:Disease"
object_label="jMONDO:0008908"
primary_knowledge_source="infores_omim"
publications=["PMID:123456","PMID:76543"]

Since the value  of the "subject_taxon" column is "NCBITaxon:9606", the row passes the filter

Generated CQL
MATCH(s:`biolink:Gene` {id:'HGNC:11802'})
MATCH(t:`biolink:Disease` {id:'MONDO:0008908'})
CREATE (s)-[:`biolink:causes`{primary_knowledge_source:'infores_omim',
  pulications:["PMID:123456","PMID:76543"]}]->(t)

 Thanks.
