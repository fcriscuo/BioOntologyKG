As a Neo4j v2025 expert, please generate a Cypher Query Language (CQL) script that
will create relationships between existing database nodes. Please adhere to
the following specifications:

1. The CQL script will be submitted to a Neo4j Browser connected to a local Neo4j database.
2. The script should process all existing `biolink:Gene` nodes.
3. The script should create a "HAS_SEQUENCE_ONTOLOGY" relationship from a `biolink:Gene` node to
   a "SequenceOntologyTerm" node based on the `biolink:Gene`:type property matching the
   SequenceOntologyTerm:id property
4. The script should create a "HAS_HGNC" relationship from a `biolink:Gene` node to a HGNC node
   based on `biolink:Gene`:id property matching the HGNC:hgnc_id property.
5. The script should process all existing "Gene" nodes in the database and create a "HAS_BIOLINK_GENE"
   relationship from a "Gene" node to the `bioink:Gene` node base on the Gene:GENE_SYMBOL property
   matching the `bioink:Gene`:symbol property
6. The creation of these relationships should be within 1 or 2 Neo4j CALL blocks with a
   transaction count of 1000

Thank you
