As a Neo4j v2025 expert, please generate a Cypher Query Language (CQL) script that
will import MonarchKG node data from a tsv-formatted file. Please adhere to
the following specifications:
1. The TSV column names are: id, category, name, description, in_taxon, in_taxon_label, t
    symbol, synonyms, xref, synonym, full_name, type, has_gene, exact_synonym,
    broad_synonym, narrow_synonym, related_synonym, deprecated, iri, same_as, subsets,
     and provided_by
     These names should be used as node property names.
 2. The "category" column should be used as the Neo4j node label
 3. The TSV file contains data that will map to multiple node labels. (e.g. biolink:Pathway, biolink:Gene)
 4. Column values enclosed by brackets (i.e. '[' and ']') should be imported into Neo4j as
    lists (e.g. ['ENSEMBL:ENSG00000105131', 'OMIM:617400']). The single quote marks (i.e. ') should be removed before
    importing into Neo4j (e.g. 'OMIM:617400' -> OMIM:617400). In most cases, bracketed data will contain comma separated
    values (e.g. ['ENSEMBL:ENSG00000074800', 'OMIM:172430']),  but there will be bracketed data that have ony a single
    value. The latter should still be imported as a list.
 5. Column values that contain commas, but are not within brackets (e.g. RNA, U7 small nuclear 52 pseudogene) should
    be imported as a String
 6. The 'in_taxon' column should not be imported.
 7. The TSV file to be imported is '/Volumes/SSD870/data/MonarchKG/monarch-kg/human_monarch-kg_nodes.tsv'

Thank you
