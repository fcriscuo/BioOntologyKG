As a Neo4j v2025 expert, please generate a Cypher Query Language (CQL) script that
will import MonarchKG NCIT relationship data from a tsv-formatted file. Please adhere to
the following specifications:

1. The file defines various relationship types between existing NCIT_Term nodes in a Neo4j v2025 database.
2. The TSV input file is: /Volumes/SSD870/data/MonarchKG/ncit_kgx_tsv_edges.tsv
3. The Neo4j database is local
4. The TSV "subject" column contains the NCIT_ID property of the source NCIT_Term node for the relationship
5. The TSV "predicate" column represents the label for the relationship
6. The TSV "knowledge_source" column represents the knowledge_source propert for the relationship
7. The TSV "object" column contains the NCIT_ID property of the destination NCIT_Term node
8. The TSV file is very large, so relationships should be created in batches of 1000
9. The NCIT_ID property for NCIT_Term nodes has an existing index

Example:
id	subject	predicate	object	relation	knowledge_source
urn:uuid:2d3f509d-f5ec-4267-9e34-c5f390d5706f	NCIT:C126405	biolink:subclass_of	NCIT:C54131	rdfs:subClassOf	NCIT 2025-08-06

MATCH (n1:NCIT_Term {NCIT_ID: row.subhect})
MATCH (n2:NCIT_Term {NCIT_ID:row.object})
CREATE (n1)-[r:row.predicate{knowledge_source:row.knowledge_source}]->(n2)

Thanks.
