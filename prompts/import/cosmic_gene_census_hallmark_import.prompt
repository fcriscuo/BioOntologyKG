As a Neo4j v5 expert, please generate a Cypher Query Language (CQL) script that 
will import COSMIC_CancerGeneCensusHallmarksOfCancer data from a tsv-formatted file. Please adhere to 
the following specifications:
1. The input tsv file is file:///Volumes/SSD870/COSMIC_rel102/Import/Cosmic_CancerGeneCensusHallmarksOfCancer_v102_GRCh38.tsv
2. The first line of the tsv file consist of column headings
3. After the header line, each subsequent line should be used to create a new  COSMIC_Cancer_Gene_Hallmark node.
4. Each column in a tsv row should be used to create a property in the COSMIC_Cancer_Gene_Hallmark node. The property name should be
   the same as the column name,
7. The CQL script should create a HAS_HALLMARK relationship between a COSMIC_Cancer_Gene node and the COSMIC_Cancer_Gene_Hallmark node being 
   processed. The joing property should be the COSMIC_GENE_ID property in both nodes
8  If the row being processed contains a value for the PUBMED_PMID property, the CQL script should create a HAS_PUBLICATION relationship
   from the COSMIC_Cancer_Gene_Hallmark node being processed to Publication node whose pubmed_id property is the same as the PUBMED_PMID value.
   If a Publication node with that pubmed_id value does not exist, a new Publication node should be created.
9. The CQL script should contain a Cypher command to DETACH and DELETE all  COSMIC_Cancer_Gene_Hallmark nodes to faciliate
   rerunning the script as needed
10. The CQL script should be outputted as cql/import/import_cosmic_gene_census_hallmark.cql
11. Do not attempt to execute the CQL script.
